Fix for Invoice Validation Accounting Entry Issue

This script fixes the issue where accounting entries are incorrectly created or displayed during
invoice validation. According to business requirements, accounting entries should only be created
for seller uploaded invoices that are funded, not during validation.

The script patches the validate_invoice function in bank_portal.py to ensure no accounting entries
are created or displayed during validation.

## Issue
During invoice validation, an accounting entry message was incorrectly displayed:
```
Invoice validation completed - Status updated to 'Validated'
Accounting entry created: VALIDATION-[timestamp]
```

## Business Requirements
According to business requirements:
- No accounting entry should be created during validation
- Only seller uploaded invoices that are funded need accounting entries to pay the seller
- For buyer uploaded invoices, accounting entries only start when the seller approves the invoice for early payment

## Fix
This patch removes any accounting entry creation or display during the invoice validation process.
