# Invoice Validation Fix

## Issue
During invoice validation, an accounting entry message was incorrectly displayed:
```
Invoice validation completed - Status updated to 'Validated'
Accounting entry created: VALIDATION-20250629-073341
```

## Business Requirements
According to the business requirements:
- No accounting entry should be created during validation
- Only seller uploaded invoices that are funded need accounting entries to pay the seller
- For buyer uploaded invoices, accounting entry only starts when the seller approves the invoice for early payment with the quoted discount rate sent by the bank admin

## Fix
This fix ensures that no accounting entry message is displayed during invoice validation.

The fix consists of:
1. Adding explanatory comments to the validate_invoice function
2. Ensuring no accounting entries are created during validation

## Testing
To verify the fix, validate an invoice and confirm that no accounting entry message is displayed.
